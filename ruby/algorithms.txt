* Release 0 - Algorithm for using an elevator *

- Get department for placing a bid
	- Search database for department’s level number

- Go to the elevator

- Scan elevator for level number

- Figure out if you need to go up or down by subtracting current level number from department’s level number
	- If department’s level number - level number is 	  greater than zero 
		- push up button
	- If less than zero
		- push down button
	- If equals zero
		- Go place the bid

- When elevator door is open walk in

- Locate floor buttons

- Start from the lowest floor button compare each floor button number to department’s level number 
	- Until you find a match
		- Push the button
		- when arrived at the department place the 		  bid
	- If no match
		- Come back 


Release 1 - Keeping track of your car’s fuel consumption 

-Use the algorithm when filling up the gas tank.

- If using the algorithm for the first time:

	- Get the current_mileage

	- Get the date

	- Print the date, current_mileage, and the 		  message “mpg is not available at this time”

	- Set the last_mileage equal to current_mileage 	  (last_mileage = current_mileage)

- Otherwise:

	- Get current_mileage

	- Get the date 

	- Get number of gallons_used 

	- Calculate distance_traveled (current_mileage - 	  last_mileage)

	- Calculate mpg (distance_traveled / 	 		  gallons_used)

	- print mpg

	- Set the last_mileage equal to current_mileage 	  (last_mileage = current_mileage)
